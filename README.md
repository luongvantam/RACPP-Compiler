Depending on your host operating system platform, launch the dedicated automated script file located inside the compiler directory:

- **On Windows Platforms:** Double-click on `run.bat` (or execute via PowerShell/CMD environment).
- **On Linux / macOS Environments:** Launch terminal in the root directory path and execute `run.sh`:

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

  2. At the main prompt, enter the exact source file name or full path to compile and press `Enter`.
  3. You can use the following interactive commands:
     - `!q`: Quit the compiler.
     - `!m`: Change the target model.
